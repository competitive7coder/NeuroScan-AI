## Project Overview

NeuroScan AI is a full-stack explainable artificial intelligence system developed for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system integrates Grad-CAM for heatmap-based explainable AI visualization, a FastAPI backend for prediction and data management, and a web-based frontend interface for user interaction.

The platform also includes PDF medical report generation, prediction history tracking, and an admin analytics dashboard. The frontend is deployed on Netlify and the backend is deployed on Render. The trained deep learning model is optimized and deployed using ONNX Runtime for efficient inference.

This project integrates Machine Learning, Backend Development, Frontend Development, Database Management, REST API Development, and Cloud Deployment into a complete AI-based web platform.

## Project Motivation

Brain tumor diagnosis using MRI images is a complex and time-consuming process that requires expert radiologists. The goal of this project is to assist medical professionals by developing an AI system that can automatically analyze MRI images and predict whether a tumor is present or not.

The system also provides explainable AI visualization (Grad-CAM heatmap) to show which region of the MRI image influenced the model’s decision.

---

## Dataset Source

The brain MRI dataset used for training the model was collected from publicly available medical imaging datasets and brain MRI tumor classification datasets available on Kaggle and other open research sources.

The dataset contains MRI brain images categorized into:

- Tumor
- No Tumor

## Grad-CAM Heatmap (Explainable AI)

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to visualize which region of the MRI image influenced the model’s prediction.

### Grad-CAM Workflow

Input Image  
↓  
CNN Forward Pass  
↓  
Compute Gradients  
↓  
Generate Heatmap  
↓  
Overlay Heatmap on Image

This makes the AI system explainable and suitable for medical applications.

Benefits of ONNX:

Faster inference
Lower memory usage
No TensorFlow dependency on server
Better deployment compatibility
Smaller runtime environment
